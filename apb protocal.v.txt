->PRESEAT:SYNCRONOSED RESET
->PADR:apb can only have [31:0] as adder value
->PDATA:DATA can 8or16or 32 bits
->pwrite: write =1
->pstb:it can have only[3:0] because it is used to find how many bits of data is valid that means these add is divided into 4 parts 0-7&8-15&16-23&23-31 if all are 1 then it is has full address
->psel:used to select the alave

THERE FOUR STAGES :
IDEAL STATE: WERE the psel and penable aree low where no transection take place
SETUP STATE: whene psel is high and penable is low in these state we must have the pwrite high
		and we should have getten the address (padd)and also writedata(pwdata)if writing 
		read detailes must be low if read write details must be low
ACCES: the penable must be high in the next clock tick after setup state at time of 
	penable is high pready is also should be high

COMPLETE TRANS : at these time transection must complete weather read or write data to are from memory
		if there is no slaveerror
